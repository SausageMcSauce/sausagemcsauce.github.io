    <h2>Stuff I made</h2>
    <h3>Carmes Inc</h3>
    <p>Carmes Inc is a fictional company, who CEO is Carmes, a character created by me.</p>
    <p>It is in the same "universe" as <a href="https://shefwerld.github.io/">Shef Werld</a>, another fictional company created by Scratcher <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/CatsUnited/">CatsUnited</a>. (Shef Werld was created first and Carmes Inc was created later)</p>
    <p><a href="/carmesinc">Link to Carmes Inc's website</a> (its part of this website)</p>
    <p><a href="history.html">History of Carmes and Carmes Inc</a></p>
    <h3>Some random comics</h3>
    <p>I sometimes make random comics that Carmes (mentioned earlier in this page) is said to make. A list of them is found <a href="comix.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>All comics were made for Shef Kerbi News Network, a fictional news thingy owned by CatsUnited's Shef Werld.</p>
