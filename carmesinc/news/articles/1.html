      <h2>NEW NEWS NETWORK MADE</h2>
      <p class="writtenby">Written by Byron (one small correction made by Carmes)</p>
      <p>After Shef Werld News Network had closed, Apple, Inc. had created a new network called "Apple News Network". Unfortunately, the owner of Apple News Network, Apple The Cat, hadn't been active after the first bulletin, causing chaos between workers, and also not publishing a second bulletin since October 25 2020. Carmes, Inc. took the opportunity and made a new news network, Carmes News.
Carmes News is a brand new news network in Dreem Lend, made by none other than Carmes, Inc. They were funded $5000 by Carmes, Inc. upon starting, which is more than Apple News Network.
There are four types of jobs. The News Reporter makes news reports. The Advertiser makes advertisements. The Weather Man reports the weather. The Comic Man makes comics.
"We hope that Carmes, Inc. can stay long, to help the people who need to know the latest news," one of the workers, Byron said, "It is located in Dreem Lend, but nevermind, since it is already announced to be a part of Earth."
Let's hope Carmes News can publish news that helps the people on Earth, no matter the location, race, age, sex, etc.</p>
      <h2>White Is Captured, Felica Is New President</h2>
      <p class="writtenby">Written by Byron</i>
      <p>After all the craziness in the past few days, The Government Scientist Association had made experiments about the brianchlofjophoezach syndrome. After a few days of hard work, our 385th president, Jeffrey White, is now officially proven to have the syndrome.
"All 498 patients has this BCFPZ virus in their blood. It is believed that this virus is the main cause of the syndrome," one of the scientists, Summer Mart said, "All the people that were in contact with White has to be kept in solitary for 364 days (26 weeks). 28 new cases are found, and 27 are captured and sent to the solitary island.
After some discussion between all parties via online meetings, Felicia Felica is elected 
to take over White's job until the election that will be held on 34 December 3497.</p>
      <h2>DREEM LEND INVITED TO UNITED COUNTRIES</h2>
      <p class="writtenby">Written by Carmes</p>
      <p>Despite being in a different universe from Dreem Lend, the United Countries of Earth has invited Dreem Lend to be a member. It was mainly made possible when Donald Spokeperson (who once posed as a different person named 'Jeffrey White') was removed from the White House and replaces by Felicia Felica and her vice 'Jeff Bide'.</p>
      <p>Keyn DDDD has yet to comment on this, as he is currently focusing on expanding his castle and sorting out the pumpkin army that ate a cave full of candy.</p>

      <h2>PORTAL MUSEUM GAIN MILLIONS OF NEW VISITORS</h2>
      <p class="writtenby">by Byron</p>
      <p>After having the Fall Guy portal added to the Portal Museum, the Portal Museum gained a lot of new visitors. Even visitors who complained so much that they don't want to step foot in the museum had visited there too.
Why is this possible? The reason has to be the popularity of the Fall Guys mobile game. It was the first in early June but was overtaken by Among Us. Among Us is technically better, compared with Fall Guys, since there's a lot of things you can do with the characters.
"We're surprised of the new-gained fame of this museum. It used to be at the bottom of the 'museum popularity list' with an average of 100 visits per month. Now, it had skyrocketed to the first in 3 days, with 318423406 visits per month!" The manager of the museum, 
Potter Portal said. The whole museum was cramped and is now open 60 hours a day.

The museum is bringing in the Among Us portal to the museum next week, which will bring more possibilities to the museum.</p>
      <h2>THE WORLD OF MATH HAD COLLAPSED</h2>
      <p class="writtenby">by Byron</p>
      <p>Math is always an annoying subject to most. Recently, Mathematician Matt Mad had announced that Math is officially categorised as "garbage" and "paradox".
The world of Math started with 0 and 1, which, is now proven equal, making everything back to 0. The world is now empty, yet at the same time, had everything.
"Say we have 20 - 20 = 25 - 25, then 4 * 5 - 4 * 5 = 5 * 5 - 5 * 5. Thus, 4 * (5 - 5) = 5 * (5 - 5). We get 4 = 5. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 0 = 1," said Matt Mad.
The world senses the problem with Math. "We're deciding if we will get rid of Math from our children's brain. Our professional, world's top 10 mathematicians are trying to either prove this or debunk this," said Orwell Lee, the leader of World Mathematics Organisation.</p>
      <h2>DOCUMENTS INVOLVING THE CARMES INC BUILDING LEAKED</h2>
      <p class="writtenby">by Carmes</p>
      <p>A random person has leaked several documents onto LeakedThings several documents involving The Carmes Inc Building's construction and planning dating from mid-2019 (around the time Carmes dissappeared from Shef Kerbi News Network), known in the documents as the 'Pig Soop Tower' (as it was built before Carmes Inc formed and when Carmes was only CEO of Nummy Foods Inc.). The documents mentions a very secret fact that PreCure Selene's house was in the basement of the tower.</p>
      <p>Red Computer Labs are trying to invent loads of security measures just in case the documents are misused.</p>
