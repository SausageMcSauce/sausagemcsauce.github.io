      <h2>ANIME-CON SUCCESSFUL</h2>
      <p class="writtenby">by Carmes</p>
      <p>Anime-Con, which was held a few days ago, has been extremely successful. A new product, Flea Extract, was announced and is now on sale today. Other popular events include the revealing of SuperPhone-tan and the announcement of several more anime-themed CarmesMoji.</p>
      <h2>HUMAN-CONTROLLED WEATHER IS NO LONGER A DREAM!</h2>
      <p class="writtenby">by Byron</p>
      <p>The weather is quite a big problem. Sometimes, it looks sunny and you decided to go for a picnic. However, a few minutes after, it started to rain and broke your plans. Sometimes, it looks like it would rain, but it just contributed to your 41 day drought streak.
Say goodbye to any of these issues! The Year Brothers are working on a cheap machine that controls the weather of your land. This machine was predicted to be first sold in January next year.
A lot of countries seemed to be interested in this machine. "This can bring in a lot of profit to agriculture," Felicia Felica stated, "We're having problems of droughts and excessive rain."
Joseph Legit, the president of Nowhereland, does not agree. "The weather is a gift of god. We should not change it."
We would like to hear from you! Please write a letter to us about your opinions.</p>
