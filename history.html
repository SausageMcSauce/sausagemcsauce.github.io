    <h1>History of Carmes and Carmes Inc</h1>
    <p>This explains the history of Carmes and Carmes Inc.</p>
    <p>Note: I have attempt to write this from the real world point of view. All actions done by Carmes are mostly done on the Shef Kerbi News Network TBGs topic.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Carmes was created on the 16th of November 2018. I had joined the TBGs the day before (I might have seen it in the Scratch Wiki and decided to join). Carmes was then hired by <a href="https://shefwerld.github.io/shefnews">Shef Kerbi News Network</a>. Carmes' name comes from the Spanish word for the colour crimson. Carmes is partially based on Crimsony, an OC I used in Scratch projects. Both have red bodies and are 'Colouries', but Carmes has gold facial features, whilst Crimsony has cyan.</p>

    <p>The first products made by Carmes to be advertised were Pig Soop and Emoji Bars, whose ads were created on the 24th of November. Carmes' Web Design, a fictional web design service, had their ad created the day later. The ad was not used until months later.</p>

    <p>Carmes dissapeared from SKNN around the 7th of January 2019. Between then and his re-appearence on the 6th of August that year (when I had to create another TBGs account,the one I am currently using), SKNN became a part of Shef Werld.</p>

    <p>When Shef Werld entered Season 4 in September, the homepage mentioned that Carmes invented Pig Soop. Carmes Inc was later formed on the 20th of October 2019, when Carmes in-universe purchased various companies, mostly ones that he had advertised.</p>
